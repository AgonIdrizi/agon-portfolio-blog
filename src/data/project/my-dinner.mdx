<heading2> The Project</heading2>

<br />{' '}

My dinner is a project that connects stores for selling food online, but it's not limited to food only!
Frontend is a React app, ant-design is used for beautiful and simple UI elements. Context Api and <a href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/">React-Query</a> are used for state management.
React.lazy alongside React.Suspense is used for code-splitting into multiple bundles!

<br />{' '}

This is my first time using React-Query in a project, and I'm very
satisfied with it. Greatly improves user-exprience (read: you only get a spinner
a first time you fetch the data, then you have cached data right there and
cache-invalidations work great out-of-the-box. It's customizable to fit every
need of your data-fetching strategies!)
