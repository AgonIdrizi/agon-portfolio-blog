<heading2> The Project</heading2>

<br />{' '}

Having your presence online is a great way to share your knowledge, 'helping others is helping yourself'!
Share a problem you have solved, or tips/tricks you know, that alone might be of much help to someone.
I decided to use Next.js for writing my portfolio, with Next you get the best of React-ecosystem, automatic code-spliting, seo, ssg and lots of great other features out-of-the-box!
I write my text in .mdx files, also you can write custom react components inside .mdx files (Really?, yes yes check this <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown">Next.js markdown</a>).
I was using tailwind-css for this project and it is really something to consider for building mobile-first modern UIs!

I hope that my knowledge will help someone, giving something back to
community!

The journey to becoming a better programmer is long and hard. We need the
best companions we can find to help us along the way. We need more than just the
technically-skilled companions; we also need companions we can talk to when the
day is done. We need companions we can sit with around the proverbial campfire
where we can laugh and commiserate about our struggles together. - 'The mediocre programmer book'
