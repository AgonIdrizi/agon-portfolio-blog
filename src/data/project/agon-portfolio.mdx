<heading2> The Project</heading2>

Having your presence online is a great way to share your knowledge, 'helping others is helping yourself'!
Share a problem you have solved, or tips/tricks you know, that alone might be of much help to someone.
I decided to use Next.js for writing my portfolio, with Next you get the best of React-ecosystem, automatic code-splitting, SEO, SSG, and lots of great other features out-of-the-box!
I write my text in .mdx files, also you can write custom react components inside .mdx files (Really?, yes yes check this <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown">Next.js markdown</a>).
I was using tailwind-css for this project and it is something to consider for building mobile-first modern UIs!

I hope that my knowledge will help someone, giving something back to
community!
