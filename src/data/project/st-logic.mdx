<heading2> The Project</heading2>

This project was a startup, funded by VC(Venture Capitalist). I was involved as a part of the front-end team. Working closely with UI/UX team, PM, QA, backend team. Transforming designs to match perfect-pixel, making UIs interactive and mobile-friendly.
This project aimed to build a tutor management system. Tutors would provide courses to students, teach online and students could participate in classes and exams!
