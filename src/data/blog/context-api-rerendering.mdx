If you work on a front-end React app, most probably in some part of your application you'll use Context-API.
Building a ThemeProvider or AuthProvider is a common usage of Context-API.

In this guide, we'll demonstrate in which situations ContextProvider re-renders and how it affects its children.
We'll also see that even if children components use optimizations strategies like React.memo, they will re-render if their Context provider re-renders!

First we create our context:

```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext();
ThemeContext.displayName = 'ThemeContext';

const ThemeProvider = (props) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState('light');
  const value = { theme, setTheme };

  return <ThemeContext.Provider value={value} {...props} />;
};

function useTheme() {
  const context = React.useContext(ThemeContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useTheme  must be used within a ThemeProvider');
  }

  const { theme, setTheme } = context;
  const changeTheme = setTheme((theme) =>
    theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'
  );

  return {
    theme,
    changeTheme
  };
}
```

Then we declare 2 components, for displaying theme and changing theme:

```jsx
const ThemeDisplay = React.memo(() => {
  const { theme } = useTheme();
  return <div>{`The current theme is ${theme}`}</div>;
});

const ThemeButton = React.memo(() => {
  const { theme, changeTheme } = useTheme();
  return <button onClick={changeTheme}> Set theme</button>;
});
```

Finally, our App component looks like this:

```jsx
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <ThemeProvider>
        <ThemeDisplay />
        <ThemeButton />
      </ThemeProvider>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}> Count: {count}</button>
    </div>
  );
```

<br />{' '}

Now let's try something, if we click the Count button, state inside App will change and App will re-render, making all its children components to re-render.

When the parent component of a provider re-renders, then ProviderComponent will re-render and all it's children too, this is default behaviour!

We have wrapped children components with React.memo, but still, they do re-render. Why this is happening?!

The take-away here is: **if ProviderComponent
re-renders, all its children will re-render, even if they are wrapped and optimized with
React.memo**.

Each time ThemeProvider re-renders, it creates new value variable:

```jsx
const value = { theme, setTheme };
```

Thus making its children re-render!

We can optimize this by wrapping value with React.useMemo (<a href='https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo'>useMemo docs</a>), and changeTheme with useCallback (<a href='https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback'>useCallback docs</a>).

```jsx
const value = React.useMemo(() => {
  return {
    theme,
    setTheme
  };
}, [theme]);
```

```jsx
const changeTheme = React.useCallback(
  () => setTheme((theme) => (theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark')),
  [setTheme]
);
```

Now if we click Count button, ThemeDisplay and ThemeButton will not re-render!

Redux uses Context under the hood and they optimize Providers too. Hope this will help someone!
